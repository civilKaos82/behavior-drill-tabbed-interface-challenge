# Behavior Drill Tabbed Interface

## Learning Competencies

* Change DOM state based on events
* Write custom event handlers in JavaScript and jQuery
* Communicate state changes via CSS and JavaScript

## Summary

Let's create a simple tabbed interface, similar to how the homepage of Socrates
behaves.

Take time to read over the CSS; it uses some intermediate techniques to get the
desired UI.

## Releases

### Release 0:  Add JavaScript to Make Tabs Live!

You can do what you need to do **without** editing the HTML or CSS.  It should
end up behaving like this: [Tabbed Interface](https://www.youtube.com/embed/cnKij6q0YG4)

Edit the JavaScript in the tabs.js file.  [Peruse the jQuery API
documentation][jqueryapi] to find methods that will do what you
need.  Make sure you're clear on what you need, first, though. :)
