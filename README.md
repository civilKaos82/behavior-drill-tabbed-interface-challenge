# Behavior Drill Tabbed Interface 
 
##Learning Competencies 

##Summary 

 Let's create a simple tabbed interface, similar to how the homepage of Socrates behaves.

You can do what you need to do **without** editing the HTML or CSS.  It should end up behaving like this:

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cnKij6q0YG4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Learning Goal

The goal is to become more familiar with how JavaScript interacts with the other part of the webpage.

## Objectives

Take time to read over the CSS; it uses some intermediate techniques to get the desired UI.

### Add JavaScript to Make Tabs Live!

Edit the JavaScript in the tabs.js file.  [Peruse the jQuery API documentation](http://api.jquery.com/) to find methods that will do what you need.  Make sure you're clear on what you need, first, though. :)
